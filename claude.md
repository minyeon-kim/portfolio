# Portfolio — [Your Name]

## Who this is for
Personal portfolio of a product designer with a computer science + IT security
background, applying to product designer / design engineer roles in English-speaking
countries. Target readers: hiring managers at privacy/security companies and
developer-tools companies (Linear, Vercel, Proton, Bitwarden). They scan for 6–8
seconds, then read case studies for judgment, not decoration.

Positioning line (hero): "Product designer with a security engineering background —
designing privacy, trust, and tools for builders."

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Case studies as MDX in /content/cases
- Animation: GSAP (ScrambleText, ScrollTrigger) for the hero; Motion for component transitions
- Fonts: Geist and Geist Mono via next/font
- Deploy: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (static export: output 'export',
  images.unoptimized true, no server features). Keep it portable so it can move
  to Vercel later. Custom domain will be connected.

## Design system (do not invent new values)
Colors are CSS variables on :root with a dark override via prefers-color-scheme and
[data-theme="dark"]:
- --bg #F5F6F4 / #0C0E0E
- --surface #FFFFFF / #151918
- --ink #0E1111 / #E8ECEA
- --muted #5B6461 / #8E9895
- --line #DADFDC / #262C2A
- --accent #2440F0 / #7F93FF  (the ONLY accent; links, focus, demo states)
Type scale: 13 / 15 / 18 / 24 / 36 / 64 px. 64px is used only in the hero.
Geist for text, Geist Mono for labels, metadata, and scramble text.
Layout: max-width 1200px; case body 680px; 16px min side padding; 8px spacing grid.
Radius: 6px on cards and controls, nothing larger. Borders 1px var(--line). No drop shadows.
Motion: 150/250/400ms, ease cubic-bezier(0.2,0.8,0.2,1).

## Signature motif: "Decrypted"
Text scramble (encrypted -> readable) is the single expressive motif. Use it ONLY in:
the hero headline (once on load, max 1.2s), and nav link hover. Nowhere else.

## Rules
- Content first: the hero must show name, positioning line, and the two featured
  case studies without scrolling on a 1440x900 screen.
- Never block scrolling, never add a preloader, never hijack scroll.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: show final text instantly, disable scramble/parallax.
- Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast, visible focus ring (2px var(--accent)),
  full keyboard support for every interactive demo, semantic headings.
- Performance: Lighthouse 95+ on mobile; images pre-sized WebP via next/image (unoptimized); lazy-load demos.
- Every case study page follows the template: TL;DR (Problem / My role / Outcome),
  Context, Problem, Research, Decisions (with "Why I chose this" toggles),
  Interactive demo, Outcome & learnings. Mark self-initiated work with a [CONCEPT] label.
- No lorem ipsum. Use text from /content. If content is missing, leave a visible
  TODO comment instead of inventing facts or metrics.
- No third-party logos implying affiliation (e.g. no Google logo on the Gemini concept).
- Copy is in English, plain and specific. No emoji in UI.

## Working style
- One feature per task. Run the dev server and check the page before saying done.
- Commit after each completed step with a clear message.
